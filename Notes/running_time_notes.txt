Current bottle neck is Eigen's BDCSVD implementation. Possible alternatives are
the SVD implementation provided in the Armadillo library or even a commercial
solution such as MATLAB. It seems that these library offer a faster implementation,
even when using compiler optimisation for Eigen (see the CMake file).

Another alternative would be to use a GPU based SVD solver; however it is known
that for a benefit to be observed over CPU based SVD solvers, the dimension N
must be significantly large. For commercial scale SAT instances however, this is
the case.
